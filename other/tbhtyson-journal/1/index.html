      <h2>Passage 1 | Why you should try Linux</h2></div>
  <div class='center'>
      <p>Chances are, you have either heard linux is hard to use, never heard of linux, or are using linux right now. (If you are in the latter group, go browse other stuff.) Linux is an OS kernel, meaning it is the stuff between hardware/firmware and software. When I refer to linux, I mean the kernel, not gnu/linux. Now with that out of the way, lets talk linux. Linux is easy to use, just look at fedora kde spin and linux mint. Both use gnu coreutils, making them gnu/linux. Linux is very customizable. On windows and mac, there is not much customization for most things. On linux, you can customize everything. (I'm not joking, you can customize everything. Even the code for the bootloader itself is customizable.) That's why you should try linux. </p>
